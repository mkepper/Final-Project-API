# Final-Project-API
The intention of the API that I have created is to provide the names, abbreviations, and times in comparison to GMT for all core time zones in the world.

In order to use this API all one would need to do is request access from the database and pull down the data.

Once they have the data they could utilise it to calculate differenet timezones for perspective clients, time global events, or even adjust payroll for cross national employees.

This project is accompanied by an interface that would allow the user to select the time zone they are in and compare that time zone to Central time.

Another feature of this project is the ability to view all of the API data and edit any of the entries as long as you have access to the API to start.
